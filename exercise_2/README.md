# Exercise 2

* Write a program in which two processes repeatedly pass a message back and forth.
* Insert timing calls to measure the time taken for one message (send+receive).
* Investigate how the time taken varies with the size of the message.
* Investigate how the time taken varies with the size of the message.
* Use message sizes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., ~1 Mio or 1, 10, 100, 1000, ..., 1 Mio
* Loop over message sizes
* In the loop time this block of code with MPI_Wtime
* Print out a table:
