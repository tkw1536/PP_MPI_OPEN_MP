# Exercise 1
* Type (do not use cut and paste!) the Hello-world program using an editor on the course computers (use either C or Fortran) [0_simple](0_simple)
* Compile the program
* Run the program
* Modify your program, so that only the process with rank 0 prints out  [1_simple](1_simple)
* Extend the Hello-world program, so that it also writes the total number of processes and the rank of the process in each output line [2_simple](2_simple)
* Compile and run the program with different numbers of processes
